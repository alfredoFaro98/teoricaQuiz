Overview
The course covers the fundamental aspects of theoretical computer science, such as 
the notions of decidability and computational complexity.
The first module (Part A) introduces students to the basics of Theoretical Computer 
Science, with particular attention to formal languages, Turing machines, computability 
theory, undecidability and incompleteness in first-order logic.
The second module (Part B) provides the basics of computational complexity theory. 
Students will be able to distinguish among tractable, untractable and presumably 
untractable problems. They will be also able to formally determine the exact 
computational complexity of a number of problems which are of practical interest.

Methods and criteria for learning assessment
Students’ knowledge, skills, and expertise are assessed through an integrated written 
and oral examination. For each module, the exam consists of:
▪ 15 multiple-choice questions (all written)
▪ 10 about basic knowledge (to assess students’ understanding of fundamental concepts, 
definitions, and principles in TCS)
▪ 5 about practical skills (to evaluate students’ ability to solve specific problems or tasks effectively)
▪ 3 open-ended questions (1 written and 2 oral)
▪ about comprehensive understanding (to verify students’ capacity to articulate and discuss 
broader topics or themes in TCS in a clear, accurate, and concise manner)
Open-ended questions are graded as follows:
▪ -1 (incorrect/unsatisfactory), 0 (no response), 1 (satisfactory), 2 (good), or 3 (excellent)

Methods and criteria for learning assessment
Let 𝑥 denote either “A” or “B”. Accordingly, let 𝑀part_𝑥 denote the count of correct multiple-choice 
questions about part 𝑥, and let 𝑂part_𝑥
𝑖  denote the grade obtained for the 𝑖-th open-ended question of 
part 𝑥. We calculate the 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞 as follows:
1. Calculate the grade 𝐺part_𝑥 of each part 𝑥:
▪ 𝐺part_𝑥 = 9+𝑀part_𝑥 +𝑂part_𝑥
1 +𝑂part_𝑥
2 +𝑂part_𝑥
3
2. Compute the arithmetic mean of the grades for the two modules:
▪ 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞 = round
𝐺part_A+𝐺part_B
2
3. To pass the exam and effectively obtain the 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞:
▪ Each 𝑀part_𝑥 must be at least 9
▪ Each 𝐺part_𝑥 must be at least 18
4. If 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞 ≥ 30, then the committee considers whether to award honors (30 cum laude).

The Universal Turing Machine (UTM) is a foundational concept in computer science, pivotal for its 
ability to simulate any TM. Its role in computability theory is crucial, showcasing the universality of 
computation, despite a potential computational overhead. Generally, the UTM is a 3-tape TM denoted 
by U. Essentially, U takes in input on Tape 1 the pair <M, w>, encoding a TM M and string w over M’s 
alphabet. Upon initiation, <M> shifts to Tape 2, leaving Tape 1 with input string <w>, mimicking M’s 
tape over w. Tape 2 stores TM M’s encoding, serving as the “program” executed by U. Tape 3 encodes 
an M state, essential for mimicking M over w. A typical alphabet of U is
U = { ( , ) ,  a ,  q ,  y ,  n ,  h , 0 , 1 ,  ;  ,  → , }. 
The encoding of an M’s state q4 may look like q0100, whereas the encoding of an M’s symbol c may 
look like a011. The encoding of a transition of the form (q,❑, s, a, →) may look like the string 
(q01;a00;q00;a01;→) over U.

Today’s Programming
Today's programming landscape is vastly different from the past:
▪ We now work with high-level languages like C++, Java, Python, and more
▪ Modern programmers may struggle to understand code written decades ago
Why is it important to study the Science of Computing?
▪ Learning the science of computing goes beyond mastering programming languages. 
▪ It involves understanding the mathematical properties of problems and algorithms that 
remain constant regardless of technological advancements or programming trends. 
▪ Fundamental principles of computing remain valid across all hardware platforms, defining the 
boundaries of computability, independent of processing power or memory.

Why TCS Remains Essential in the Age of AI
Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) is fundamental to computing, even as Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to 
evolve. Its relevance lies in its deep exploration of computation itself: 
▪ TCS delves into the core principles of computing, addressing questions about what is computable (computability), 
the complexity of solving problems (computational complexity), ensuring information security (cryptography), 
logical reasoning (logic), and even exploring quantum computing (beyond the scope of this course). 
▪ Using tools like circuits, complexity classes, decision trees, and Turing machines, TCS defines the limits and 
possibilities of computation.
Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence focuses on building systems that mimic human cognitive abilities, such as speech 
recognition, natural language understanding, decision-making, and image processing:
▪ AI relies on techniques like machine learning, expert systems, and rule-based models. However, TCS provides the 
theoretical foundation necessary for designing, analyzing, and improving these AI systems. 
▪ In essence, TCS enriches our understanding of computation, guiding AI's evolution and ensuring its rigorous 
development.
